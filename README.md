# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

This repository is a collection of Power BI dashbaords I have developed. It tracks my journey in using Power BI, from foundational reports to more advanced interactive analysis all aimed in turning data into clear, actionalble insights.

# Feature Dashboards

Explore the dashboards below. Each has its own dedicated README with more details on the build process and specific features.
